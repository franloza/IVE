#Meeting (13/09)
- Title: Depth perception: Effects of Head Tracking in Analysing Graphs in 3D 
- Primary goal: Replicate the experiment of the paper and compare the results. Try to add new conclusions adding additional measures that Oculus could 
    provide us.
- Experiment: Find if two nodes are connected in a network. Raise the complexity in each level increasing the number of nodes.
- Purpose:
    * Measure some metrics and compare its evolution while we increase the complexity: Error, time, distance traversed with head movement.
    * We want to meausure and evaluate the movement inside the scenario as an aditional metric, with a joystick or mouse. The person always appear at the center of the graph 
and he/she has to move to find the correct path.
    * Analyze the result through graphics, heatmaps and other kind of charts using the metrics gathered by us and provided by Oculus
- Difficulties:
    * Retrieve some metrics from OR.
    * Interpret the results correctly.
    * Design appropiate levels for our analyzing purpose in order to get useful data.
    * Get familiar with Unity and Oculus Rift environment
    * Technical difficulties/limitations. Frame rate, graphics rendering...
- Research questions:
    * How the different metrics we take into account (Time, movement) are affected by the complexity of the network?
    * Is it possible to predict the behavior of the subject according to the defined metrics?
    * How similar are the obtained results with the paper?
- Roles:
    * Thomas: Computer graphics expert
    * Diego: Theory and literature consultant
    * Fran:  Data analyst
    * Mauro: Coordination, version control and reporting.
