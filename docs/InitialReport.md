* Allegretta, Mauro - Coordination, version control and reporting
* Ambite, Diego - Theory and literature consultant

* Rinsma, Thomas - Computer graphics specialist

## 2. Problem statement
The main goal for this project is to replicate one of the experiments carried out in the provided paper *Evaluating Stereo and Motion Cues for Visualizing
Information Nets in Three Dimensions*. This experiment consists on analysing the difference between visualizing network graphs in 2D and 3D. This difference will be specified in terms of different metrics such as time, error percentage and scores made by the subjects regarding to the difficulty.
As a result of the experiment, we will be able to extract conclusions about which type of vision is better for visualizing graphs.

In addition to the metrics proposed in the experiment, we will try to extract additional conclusions of 3D vision by measuring additional metrics such us the distance traversed by the head or the distance that the subject traverse inside the scenario. The purpose of this additional metrics is to verify if there exists a correlation between the complexity of the graph and the amount of movement that is required to visualize in 3D. If this correlation does not exist, we will be able to conclude that 3D does not support the task visualizing complex graphs.

Finally, we will have to overcome some difficulties that would lead to the failure of the experiment. Some of these difficulties are:
* Retrieve some metrics from Oculus Rift and get used to the Unity framework.
* Design appropriate levels for our analysis purpose in order to get useful data.
* Technical difficulties/limitations regarding to frame rate, graphics rendering...
